_Vue.js Meetup Amsterdam Netherlands is here and we start with a bang. Vue.js Meetup Amsterdam â€“ Stay tuned for massive Vue.js news in the furthcoming weeks. Vue.js Community has been crying out for a Vue.js Meetup group so here it is_

## From prototyping to production

_Speaker_: Victor Garrido

### On frameworks

Frameworks are there to help during development. The management of the framework, thus, should be least important. Requirements to use a framework: 
+ it should be possible to start fast
+ documentation should be good

### Why Vue.js?

1. Vue is approachable. It enables to easily prototype projects.
2. No need to build any tools, similar to using the react library. 
3. Vue.js makes use of templates. 
4. It is fast and lightweight.
5. [Vue.js, red.] "just allows me to do it!"

### Ecosystem

State management(Vuex), Routing(vue-router), Native(weex <-- not used).
Vuex is different from Redux. Routing: straightforward. 



## Storybook in Vue.js

_Speaker_: Norbert de Langen

Norbert published a storybook using Vue and introduced a story book in React for a client before. The main problem Norbert experiences: to reach certain components in a large angular.js application you have to direct them to get them in a certain state. Solution: Isolated Component Driven Development. View components in isolation, display them in different settings/states. 

New issues vs. pull requests. "We get a lot of pull requests from contributors" Issues are solved, so the codebase is healthy. 



## Migrating from Angular to Vue.js
_Speaker_: Paul Bastowski

Paul works at Sytac. Its major client is KLM. Developing KLM apps for internal use. 

On Angular vs. Vue.js: employees stated "it is not going to look good on our CV's if we keep using Angular". Angular 2 became a very complex variant of Angular 1.

### Why switching to Vue.js 2?

1. Can't find people who want to code  Angular.jS. 
2. Project has budget to modernise the codebase. 
3. Opportunity to learn something new. 

### Benefits of Vue.js 2:
1. Great documentation "we spent a weekend" [learning Vue.js, red.] --> [Vue.js Documentation](https://vuejs.org/) + [Udemy course on Vue](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/)
2. Large ecosystem --> [Awesome Vue on Github](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue)
3. Fastest growing front-end framework --> [Best Of](https://bestof.js.org/tags/framework/trending/this-month)
