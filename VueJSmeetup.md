_Vuejs Meetup Amsterdam Netherlands is here and we start with a bang. Vuejs Meetup Amsterdam â€“ Stay tuned for massive Vuejs news in the furthcoming weeks. Vuejs Community has been crying out for a Vuejs Meetup group so here it is_

## From prototyping to production

_Speaker_: Victor Garrido

### On frameworks

Frameworks are there to help during development. The management of the framework, thus, should be least important. Requirements to use a framework: 
+ it should be possible it start fast, 
+ documentation should be good.

### Why vue?

1. Vue is approachable. It enabled to prototype projects. 
2. No need to build any tools, just as when using the react library. 
3. Vue.js makes use of templates. 
4. It is fast and lightweight
5. [Vue.js, red.] "just allows me to do it!"

### Ecosystem

State management(Vuex), Routing(vue-router), Native(weex <-- not used).
Vuex is different from Redux. Routing: straightforward. 



## Story Book in Vue.js

Speaker: _Norbert de Langen_
[https://github.com/ndelangen](https://github.com/ndelangen)

Released a story book for Vue. Introduced storybook in React for a client before. Problem Norbert experiences: in a large angular.js application, to reach certain components you have to direct them to get them in a certain state. Solution: Isolated Component Driven Development. View components in isolation, display in different settings/states. 

New issues vs. pull requests. "we get a lot of pull requests from contributors" Issues are solved, so the codebase is healthy. 



## Migrating from Angular to vueJS
_Speaker:_ Paul Bastowski

Developing KLM apps for internal use. 

On Angular vs. Vue.js: employees stated "it is not going to look good on our CV's if we keep using angular". Angular 2 became a very complex variant of Angular 1.

### Why switching to VueJS 2?

1. Can't find people who want to code  AngularJS. 
2. Project has budget to modernise the codebase. 
3. Opportunity to learn something new. 

### Benefits of VueJS 2:
1. Great documentation "we spent a weekend" [learning Vue.js] --> [Vue.js Documentation](https://vuejs.org/ + "Vue.js") + [Udemy course on Vue](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/ + "Vue.js: the complete guide)
2. Large ecosystem --> [Awesome Vue on Github](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue)
3. [Fastest growing front-end framework](https://bestof.js.org/tags/framework/trending/this-month)
